# MinIO-Dist

This repository automates the MinIO build process, creates binaries and container images from it, and publishes them as
releases or on Docker Hub. New releases are automatically created once a new tag is pushed to the upstream MinIO
repository. This project is a direct result of MinIO going source-only for the community edition.
